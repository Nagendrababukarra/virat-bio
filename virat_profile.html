    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <i>
        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli,
        worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
        Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his
        early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early
        affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl
        to him.
        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd
        espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged
        for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered
        enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited
        more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable
        to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly
        received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he
        declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received
        training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy
        located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to
        Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.

        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.[13][16] During his
        childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as
        the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at
        times.[10][17] According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took
        cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[13]
        Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.
